## 部署
下面是使用github actions部署vitepress的配置

```yaml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a VitePress site to GitHub Pages
#
name: Deploy VitePress site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the `main` branch. Change this to `master` if you're
  # using the `master` branch as the default branch.
  push:
    branches: [main]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: pages
